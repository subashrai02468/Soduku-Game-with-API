### Project Structure
1. **index.html**: The main HTML file with the web page structure, including the Sudoku puzzle table and a solve button.
2. **styles.css**: Contains CSS styles for the page elements.
3. **app.js**: The main JavaScript file with logic for solving the Sudoku puzzle and updating the solution on the page.

### index.js File Analysis
- **Server Setup**:
  - `const PORT = 8000`: Sets the server port to 8000.
  - `const axios = require('axios').default`: Imports the Axios library for making HTTP requests.
  - `const express = require('express')`: Imports Express, a web application framework for Node.js.
  - `const app = express()`: Creates an Express application.
  - `const cors = require('cors')`: Imports the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) library.
  - `app.use(cors())`: Enables CORS for all routes.
  - `require('dotenv').config()`: Configures the dotenv library to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
  - `app.use(express.json())`: Middleware to parse JSON request bodies.

- **Sudoku Solving Endpoint**:
  - `app.post('/solve', (req, res) => {...})`: Defines a POST endpoint at `/solve`. This endpoint receives a Sudoku puzzle and returns the solution.
    - `req.body`: Contains the Sudoku puzzle sent in the request body.
    - `axios.request(options)`: Sends a POST request to the 'https://solve-sudoku.p.rapidapi.com/' API with the puzzle data.
    - `options`: Configures the request with headers (including the RapidAPI key from environment variables) and the puzzle data.
    - `res.json(response.data)`: Sends back the solution received from the API.

- **Starting the Server**:
  - `app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`server running on PORT ${PORT}`))`: Starts the server on the specified port and logs a message to the console.

### How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter the Sudoku puzzle into the table.
3. Click the "Solve" button. The solution will be displayed in the table.

This `index.js` file sets up an Express server that communicates with an external Sudoku solving API to provide solutions to puzzles. The user interface for inputting and displaying the Sudoku puzzle is handled by `index.html` and styled by `styles.css`.
